# Wealth-of-Nations-Project
Working with Tableau and Excel on this project.
## Project Overview 
In this project, I was using the Wealth of Nations data which contains information on the rank, GDP per capita, country, and year. It offers a comprehensive overview of economic indicators across various nations over time. The dataset enables analysis of trends in economic performance, comparisons between countries, and the impact of economic policies on GDP per capita. By examining this data, researchers can gain insights into patterns of economic growth, development disparities, and factors influencing national wealth accumulation. 

## Excel 
I created charts to highlight important information about the data.
